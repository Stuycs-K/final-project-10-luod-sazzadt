## Overview
This project is an astrophysics simulation of stellar evolution, or the life cycle of a star. The simulation contains a visualization of all the main stages of a star's life, including stellar nebula, protostar, main-sequence star, red giant, planetary nebula, supernova, and stellar remnant (white dwarf, neutron star, or black hole). The simulation is moderately interactive, mainly depending on the user to choose the starting density of the molecular cloud, which serves as the basis of a star's life and determines its future path. All the statistics and numbers displayed are calculated using real scientific and astronomical equations and provide an accurate depiction of the star's characteristics at each stage of its life.
